# Hardware Notes and Tips

## Wheels

### Tyres

- Tread: relevant to grip and rolling speed/resistance
- Size: Matched to Rim
- Width: Run larger front to rear is a great option, allowing rear to slip before front. 2.4-2.6 front and 2.2 to 2.4 rear
- Compound: Can be single or multiple(hard/medium/soft) make up for both walls and tread

### Rims

- Material: Commonly aluminium, Carbon at the top end
- Width: 29mm to 35mm, wider not always better
- Size: 29" rolls great, 27.5" turns easy and lighter, mullet config is an option (f:29", r:27.5)
- Tubeless: To run tubeless need a tyre bead seat
